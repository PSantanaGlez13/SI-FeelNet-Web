    <h3>What is Feelnet?</h3>
    <p>Feelnet is an application that runs a search on social media (at the moment, Reddit) 
       and does sentiment analysis on the results. <br> This could be a very useful tool for brands that want to do
       market research before releasing a product or want to be aware on how people is receiving their product.</p>
